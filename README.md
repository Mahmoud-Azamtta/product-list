# Product List

A simple Front end project for an application to displays a list of products, and the user can filter them by category.

## About the repo

This project has to part (phase 1, phase 2), the same application is developed in both phases, but in different approaches.

1. Phase 1: using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Phase 2: using React.

## Running the application

For phase 1 I used `live-server` CLI tool to run it. You can install it with the command `npm install -g live-server`, then navigate to `phase_1` directory and run `live-server .`. Now the project is running on port 8080.

To run the project in phase 2, navigate to `phase_2` directory and install npm project dependencies using `npm install`. Finally, run the project with the command `npm run dev`.
