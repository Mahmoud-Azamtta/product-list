# 📦 Product List

A simple Front end project for an application to display a list of products, and the user can filter them by category.

## ℹ️ About the repo

This project has to part (phase 1 and phase 2). The same application is developed in both phases, but in different approaches.

1. Phase 1: The convensional way using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Phase 2: Using React.

## 🏃‍♂️‍➡️ Running the application

- First, clone the repo:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Mahmoud-Azamtta/product-list.git
  ```
- For phase 1 I used `live-server` CLI tool to run it. You can install it with the command:
  ```sh
  npm install -g live-server
  ```
  Then navigate to `phase_1` directory and run the live-server:
  ```sh
  cd phase_1
  live-server .
  ```
  Now the project is running on port 8080.
- To run the project in phase 2, navigate to `phase_2` directory and install project dependencies. Finally, run the project:
  ```sh
  cd phase_2
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```
